Dissertation Project - Identification of Air Pollution hotspots and the socio economic impacts.

Abstract

The issue of air pollution presents a substantial environmental and public health problem, particularly in rapidly developing regions such as South Asia. This study aims to identify air pollution hotspots in South Asia by evaluating the patterns in PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations, and examining their relationship with various socio-economic factors. The research utilises a clustering analysis approach to detect areas with significantly elevated pollution levels and explores the socio-economic landscape of these hotspots.

The Literature Review chapter highlights the severity of air pollution on both human health and the environment, emphasising the need for targeted interventions. This study expands upon current understanding by conducting a detailed analysis of pollution patterns across South Asia, pinpointing specific urban areas that require immediate attention. The findings emphasise the importance of addressing not just the environmental but also the socio-economic implications of air pollution.

The key findings suggest that cities in the Indo-Gangetic Plains are the main areas with high levels of air pollution in South Asia, with land consumption rate and population growth rate being the primary contributors to elevated pollution levels in these hotspots. The analyses also reveal some surprising results, like access to public transport not having minimal effect on air pollution levels. These insights are essential for policymakers and urban planners in devising strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of air pollution dynamics in South Asia by identifying critical hotspots and the socio-economic scenario. The research establishes a foundation for developing targeted interventions that can improve air quality and public health in the region, while also addressing broader socio-economic challenges. This work underscores the need for comprehensive policies that integrate environmental and socio-economic considerations to effectively combat air pollution in rapidly urbanising areas.
